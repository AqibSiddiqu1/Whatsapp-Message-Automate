# Whatsapp-Message-Automate

WhatsApp Message Automate is a Python program that uses the PyWhatKit module to automate the sending of messages on WhatsApp. This program allows users to send a customized message to any contact or group at a specific time of their choice, without the need to manually open WhatsApp and type the message.

Using this program is simple: the user enters the phone number of the recipient, the message they want to send, and the time they want the message to be delivered. The program then opens a new instance of WhatsApp Web and automatically logs in using the user's credentials. Once logged in, the program navigates to the chat window of the specified recipient and types out the message. Finally, the program schedules the message to be sent at the specified time using PyWhatKit's sendwhatmsg() function.

WhatsApp Message Automate can be used for a variety of purposes, such as sending reminders, scheduling messages for business or personal purposes, or automating repetitive messages. This program is a powerful tool that can save users time and effort by automating the sending of WhatsApp messages.
